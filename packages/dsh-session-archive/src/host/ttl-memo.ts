/**
 * Bounded reuse of one derived value across nearby readers.
 *
 * Two host-side derivations are recomputed by every inventory pass while
 * changing only when something outside that pass rewrites them: the
 * sessions-root directory walk (see `host/dir-index-cache.ts`) and the parsed
 * harness projection-cache index (`readProjcacheIndex`). One user action
 * triggers several passes (a chunk per batch request plus the refresh that
 * follows it), so the same unchanged input is re-derived each time. This memo
 * serves the previous derivation inside a bounded window instead.
 *
 * Reuse is only sound while the input has not changed underneath us, so the
 * window is short and the owner must invalidate explicitly after it rewrites
 * the input itself. Nothing here polls or accumulates: one entry, and a
 * derivation is always one call away.
 *
