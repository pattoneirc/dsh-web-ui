/**
 * Bounded reuse of one sessions-root directory index across inventory passes.
 *
 * Assembling the inventory walks every session directory to sum its file
 * sizes; on a root with hundreds of sessions that walk dominates the pass.
 * The panel loads the inventory, refreshes it, opens previews and issues one
 * batch request per chunk, so the same unchanged tree is re-walked several
 * times inside a few seconds. This cache serves the previous scan inside a
 * bounded window instead.
 *
 * Reuse is only sound while the tree has not changed underneath us, so the
 * window is short and the owner must invalidate explicitly after it removes
 * session storage itself. Nothing here polls or accumulates: one entry, and a
 * scan is always one call away. The window rule itself lives in
 * {@link TtlMemo}, which the projection-cache index memo shares.
 *
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-session-archive/host/dir-index-cache
