/**
 * Coverage ratchet for the dsh-web monorepo.
 *
 * The fleet runs with a bounded number of packages in flight. Seventeen serial
 * vitest launches spend most of their wall clock in process start-up and
 * collection rather than in the CPU work of any one suite, so the runs overlap
 * without changing what any of them measures. On a ten-core machine the
 * interleaved comparison measured 56.8 s at one run in flight against 38.8 s at
 * two, with two, three and four indistinguishable from each other (38.8 / 37.1
 * / 38.5 s best-case samples) - the whole win is in the first overlap.
 *
 * The ceiling is two because each package run parallelizes internally. A run
 * under the forks pool takes `availableParallelism - 1` workers, so on ten cores
 * one package already holds about ten processes and the measured peaks for the
 * whole fleet were 11 / 20 / 36 worker processes at one / two / four runs in
 * flight. Two runs is already about twice the core count; four is nearly four
 * times it, and that cost is not hypothetical: across every run observed here
 * and by the reviewer, four in flight failed 4 of 12 times while one to three in
 * flight failed 0 of 17 (Fisher two-tailed p = 0.021). Both failure modes are
 * load-shaped rather than semantic - a 2 s abort-propagation budget in
 * dsh-remote-web-ui and one live benchmark case in dsh-liangshen - so the gate
 * buys its stability by not oversubscribing the machine, and a nightly ratchet
 * that goes red on contention costs more than the seconds four runs would save.
 * On a machine with fewer than three cores the plan degrades to one run at a
 * time - exactly the serial behavior this replaced - so no small runner can be
 * made slower.
 *
 * Every package resolves vitest 4.x. The six packages that pin their own
 * vitest also declare their own @vitest/coverage-v8 at the same major; the root
 * devDependency serves the rest through Node resolution. Bumping a package's
 * vitest major therefore means bumping its provider too; a missing or
 * mismatched provider fails this gate loudly instead of silently reporting
 * nothing.
 *
 * This is a Tier-2 gate: it runs in the nightly workflow and on demand, not on
 * every pull request, because instrumenting ~4,400 tests costs minutes and the
 * pull-request lane already runs the full suite. The ratchet is what makes it
 * useful: scripts/coverage-baseline.json records the measured percentage of
 * every package and metric, and a change may not lower any of them. Branch
 * coverage is the metric worth reading, because it is the one that exposes an
 * untested failure path.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/coverage-gate.mjs                     # compare against the baseline
 *   node scripts/coverage-gate.mjs --report            # print the current table, exit 0
 *   node scripts/coverage-gate.mjs --write-baseline    # re-record the baseline
 *   node scripts/coverage-gate.mjs [names...]          # scope to packages by name
