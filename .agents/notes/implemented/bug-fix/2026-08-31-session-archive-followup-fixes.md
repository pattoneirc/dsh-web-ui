# Agent Note: Session archive follow-up fixes (titles, toggles, defaults)

Status: implemented

## Problem

Three defects surfaced in the first real-usage round of `dsh-session-archive`:

1. **Archived session titles unresolved.** The inventory enriched titles only
   from the aggregate projection-cache index (`storages/session_projcache.json`),
   which covers recent sessions only. Older and archived sessions fell back to
   `（无标题）` even though their per-session projection-cache files
   (`storages/session_projcache/sessions/<id>.json`, version-4 `record` shape)
   still hold `record.rows.title.val` and `record.identity`.
2. **Auto-maintenance checkboxes appeared dead.** `AutoSettingsPanel` read
   `settings.getSnapshot()` during render but subscribed `useSyncExternalStore`
   only to the controller store. The settings mirror replaces the snapshot
   object after each accepted write; without a subscription the controlled
   checkboxes never re-rendered, so a successful host write was visually
   invisible. (The same pattern in `dsh-usage` is masked by its poll-driven
   re-renders.)
3. **Day thresholds defaulted to 30/90**, heavier than wanted; both defaults
   should be 7 days.

## Decision

1. `buildInventory` now runs a bounded fallback pass after the index
   enrichment: rows still missing title/createdAt/cwd read their per-session
   projection-cache file (`readProjcacheFile`, tolerant of corrupt/missing
   files, `record ?? parsed` shape drift). Files never conjure rows; the
   archive service memoizes file facts in a per-id cache
   (`InventorySources.projcacheFiles`) so repeated inventory passes do not
   re-read unchanged files. Index facts keep precedence (applied first).
2. `AutoSettingsPanel` subscribes with
   `useSyncExternalStore(props.settings.subscribe, props.settings.getSnapshot)`,
   making toggles reflect the accepted host write immediately.
3. `DEFAULT_AUTO_CONFIG.autoArchiveDays`/`autoDeleteDays` and the host
   schemastery schema defaults moved 30/90 → 7/7 (config.ts + index.ts +
   README pair + fallback assertions in auto-rules.spec).

## Alternatives considered

- **Reading titles from session logs**: legacy `session.jsonl.zstd` is
  compressed; would add a zstd dependency for a fact the projection cache
  already holds. Rejected.
- **Clamp-saving invalid day input**: already rejected earlier (invalid values
  never save); unchanged.

## Consequences

- Older/archived rows resolve real titles when a per-session projection-cache
  file exists; rows with neither dir, feed entry, nor file stay `（无标题）`
  with the `no-data` flag (true ghosts).
- Both auto-maintenance switches round-trip: click → host write → mirrored
  snapshot → re-render; state survives reloads.
- Fresh installs default both thresholds to 7 days; existing explicit user
  values are untouched (schema defaults only fill absent fields).
- Verified on a sandboxed QA instance (fresh `DSH_HOME`, port 3999): seeded
  file-only session resolves `早安测试`, index beats file (`索引标题二`),
  dir-only session stays `（无标题）` with issue tags; both checkboxes toggle
  and persist across reload; day inputs show 7/7. Evidence:
  `/tmp/qa-evidence/22..24-*.png`. Host-half changes need the user-side DSH
  restart on the live instance; the client-half toggle fix ships to browsers on
  page refresh.

## Follow-up (same day): post-delete selection ghosts and the skip story

**Problem.** On the live instance a 371-target batch delete left 5 archived
rows visible and the selection bar stuck at `已选 371 项`. Diagnosis against
the real home: the 5 sessions were never deleted — their storage dirs are
intact and `archivedSessionIds` holds exactly those 5 — because they are still
held open by the running harness process (live SessionStore members). The
batch dialog did report them as skipped, but under the `running` reason
("会话正在运行") which is wrong for idle-attached sessions, and after the
post-delete inventory refresh the selection kept all 371 ids (366 of them no
longer existed), so the summary line claimed 366 items outside the filter.

**Decision.**

1. `setInventory` prunes selection to ids still present in the incoming rows.
   Selection across filter changes is preserved (unchanged); only ids the
   inventory no longer knows are dropped.
2. New stable reason code `attached` for live-store members; feed-reported
   running rows keep `running`. Copy: zh "会话仍被 DSH 进程占用，重启服务或
   关闭该会话后可删除" / en / ru (central pack).
3. The finished batch dialog aggregates skipped entries by reason
   (`跳过明细：… ×n · …`) so a 371-run's outcome reads at a glance; the
   per-id list stays for detail.

**Consequences.** The protection semantics are unchanged — sessions held open
by the running DSH process remain undeletable until the service restarts or
the session is closed; what changed is that the UI now says so honestly and
the selection counter reflects reality. QA-verified: select 3 seeded sessions
→ batch delete → dialog `成功：3 / 跳过：0`, selection counter pruned to
`已选 0 项`. Evidence: `/tmp/qa-evidence/25..27-*.png`.

## Follow-up 2 (same day): bare-uuid harness ids broke every batch

**Problem.** After the user's restart, a 213-target batch delete failed 400
`no session ids` on every chunk. Diagnosis on the real home: this install's
harness mixes id spellings natively — the feed, the registry archive set, and
the session store all hold **bare uuids** for a large share of sessions (309/741
feed rows; the archive set and the plugin ledger were 100% bare), while other
rows carry `session-<uuid>`. The route's id validator only accepted the
prefixed spelling, so every id was dropped and the empty-array guard answered
400. The earlier 371-run had worked because the then-deployed build predated
the strict validator.

**Decision.** One canonical form inside the plugin, native spellings at the
harness boundary:

1. `buildInventory` canonicalizes every id it emits (feed rows, parent links,
   workspace membership, archive-set membership, ledger lookups) to
   `session-<uuid>` via `canonicalSessionId`, and records a canonical→native
   map (`BuiltInventory.nativeIds`) for every non-canonical spelling seen.
2. `routes.idList` accepts both spellings, rejects path-unsafe strings
   (ids end up in file names), and canonicalizes before the service sees them.
3. Harness-facing calls pass the native id: `archiveSession`, `inspect`
   (preview), rdb deletes (dual attempt), archive-set unarchive and
   workspace-row removal compare canonically and preserve all other stored
   entries verbatim.
4. The archive ledger and the projection-cache scrub write canonical keys and
   clean both spellings (the existing 207 legacy bare ledger keys stay
   readable through the dual lookup).

**Consequences.** Mixed-spelling installs work end to end; the wire format is
uniformly canonical; legacy bare ledger keys are read and retired naturally. Automatic cycles pass the native-id map from their candidate inventory into the archive executor, just like manual batches. The mixed-id automatic-cycle regression covers successful native archive markers, canonical ledger keys, running/current protection, and a repeat cycle that preserves archive times.
Selection made on a pre-fix page (bare ids) is pruned by the inventory refresh
(rows are canonical) and the user re-selects. Unit-covered: bare feed ids →
canonical rows + parent links + archive flags; bare id through the delete
route cleans the bare archive-set entry; path-unsafe ids still 400.

## Follow-up 3 (same day): one directory walk per user action

**Problem.** Every inventory pass re-walked the whole sessions root to sum each session directory's file sizes (`indexSessionDirs`). On the maintainer's install that walk measured ~12.5 ms per pass over 444 session directories (of which ~11.6 ms is the recursive size sum; `realpath` ~4.2 ms, `stat` ~1.5 ms, `readdir` ~0.7 ms), and every pass also re-read the per-session projection-cache fallback (~28 ms cold over 442 files). One user action triggers several passes: a 442-target batch splits into chunks of 200, each chunk request rebuilds the inventory, and the client reloads the inventory once more afterwards — four passes for one delete. A single row **Preview** rebuilt the full inventory to display one row the panel already held. Measured: four passes 80.3 ms with the walk repeated, 52.2 ms for two.

**Decision.** `InventorySources.dirIndex` accepts a prebuilt index; the service supplies one from `DirIndexCache` (`dir-index-cache.ts`), a one-entry, 2 s TTL memo of the sessions-root scan that the owner invalidates itself after a physical delete removes storage. The pass still walks the tree on its own when no index is supplied, so `buildInventory` keeps its existing contract. Reuse is bounded rather than permanent: the window is short, one scan is always one call away, and nothing polls.

**Measured effect** (444 real session directories; the four-pass sequence one batch delete performs):

| Sequence | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Four inventory passes (one batch delete) | 80.3 ms | 42.6 ms |
| Two inventory passes | 52.2 ms | — |

The remaining cost is the projection-cache fallback reads, which `projcacheFiles` already memoizes per id; the directory walk no longer repeats inside the window.

**Alternatives considered.**

- **`readdirSync(path, { withFileTypes: true })` to drop one `stat` per subdirectory**: implemented and benchmarked, and **slower** — 6.93 ms versus 6.60 ms for the same 444 directories. Rejected on measurement.
- **A permanent directory index**: rejected — sizes and the directory map would go stale after external deletion, and correctness here decides what the delete pipeline is allowed to remove.
- **Slowing the client's chunking or dropping the post-batch refresh**: rejected — those exist so an interrupted batch lands in a retryable state and the panel reflects it; the redundant work is the repeat walk, not the refresh.
- **A TTL on the inventory response itself**: rejected as a larger behavioral change (it would also mask concurrent external changes) where the scan reuse removes the measured cost with no wire-visible difference.
- **A separate cached document for `preview()`**: re-measured after the scan reuse landed and declined — preview reaches the same `sources()`, so it already shares the walk and the per-id fact memo. Its residual 31.7 ms cold is the one-time projection-cache fact load for 444 sessions, paid once and then 0.7 ms; a second cache would memoize a cost the first one already amortizes.

**Consequences.** Sizes and the directory map can be up to 2 s behind an external deletion; the service's own deletes invalidate immediately. `preview()` still builds its own inventory and remains a candidate for a later reducer. Verified: 14 package test files / 104 tests pass, typecheck (both programs) and build pass, `test:standards`, `docs:check`, `i18n:check`, `emoji:check` and `sync-shared --check` pass. New coverage `tests/dir-index-cache.spec.ts`, 5 cases: one scan across passes inside the window, a fresh scan once it lapses, explicit invalidation removing deleted storage, a newly added directory discovered after the window, and identical rows whether the pass walks the tree or is handed the index. Negative control: neutering `invalidate()` fails the invalidation case and ignoring the TTL fails two cases. Host-half change; it reaches the GUI only after the user restarts the DSH service.
## Follow-up 4 (same day): the same bounded memo also serves the projection-cache index

**Problem.** The inventory reads the aggregate projection-cache index (`storages/session_projcache.json`) in full on every pass — one `readFileSync` plus one `JSON.parse` of the whole document — while the far larger sessions-root walk beside it is already served from a bounded memo. A size sweep over the index file measures that read and parse at 3.66 µs/KiB (R² = 0.943); on the maintainer's 112 KB index that is about 0.40 ms per pass, which is 1.2% of a cold pass and 36% of a warm pass — the pass where the walk is served from the memo. The saving is **sub-millisecond**, and it is recorded that way: it earns its place because it is the same repeated work the walk's memo already removes, on exactly the passes one user action repeats.

**Decision.** One memo type serves both reads. `ttl-memo.ts` owns `TtlMemo`: one entry, a TTL window, and an invalidation its owner calls explicitly. `DirIndexCache` is that type specialized to the sessions-root scan with its public surface unchanged, and `ArchiveService` holds a second memo for the projection-cache index, injected through `InventorySources.projcacheIndex` in `sources()`. `scrubProjcache()` — the only writer of the index file — invalidates it whenever it actually rewrote something (`ids.size > 0`). `buildInventory` still calls `readProjcacheIndex` itself when no memo is injected, so the pass keeps its contract with or without a service.

**Consequences.** A pass may read an index up to one TTL window old; the delete pipeline's own rewrite invalidates immediately, so a scrubbed title cannot survive into the next inventory. Each memo holds one entry, accumulates nothing and polls nothing. Coverage: `tests/projcache-index-memo.spec.ts`.

**Negative controls.** Removing the injection makes the guard report `expected ['Amended','Beta'] to deeply equal ['Alpha','Beta']`; removing the invalidation makes a deleted title come back as `expected 'Doomed' to be undefined`.
